> When your attention span is shorter than a TikTok video, how do you digest a 30-page paper?

## The Attention Crisis

Let me be honest with you. I am a PhD student who studies AI, and I still catch myself reaching for my phone mid-paragraph. If you have ever re-read the same sentence four times because your brain quietly wandered off to think about dinner, you are not alone.

The research is grim. A [2019 study published in Nature Communications](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09311-w) by researchers from the Technical University of Denmark and others found that our collective attention span has been measurably shrinking — on Twitter, the time a hashtag stayed in the top 50 dropped from 17.5 hours in 2013 to 11.9 hours by 2016, and similar patterns appeared in books, movies, and search trends going back over a century. We now live in a world optimised for 15-second dopamine hits. Meanwhile, academic papers remain stubbornly long, dense, and written in a style that seems designed to repel casual readers.

The mismatch is real. But the solution is not to give up on reading papers. It is to get smarter about *how* we read them.

## Why Traditional Reading Fails Us Now

The advice most of us received as undergraduates was simple: read the paper from start to finish, take notes, and repeat until you understand it. This approach assumes two things that are no longer true for most of us: that we have abundant uninterrupted time, and that our default state is one of focus.

Today, the average PhD student is juggling Slack messages, email notifications, lab meetings, teaching duties, and the gravitational pull of social media. Sitting down for two hours of deep reading is not just difficult—it is a fantasy for most days of the week.

We need strategies that work *with* our fragmented attention, not against it.

## The Three-Pass Method (Reimagined)

The classic three-pass approach, popularised by S. Keshav in his widely-cited paper ["How to Read a Paper"](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf) (ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 2007), is still the gold standard. But it needs updating for the modern brain. Here is how I have adapted it.

### Pass 1: The 60-Second Skim

Before you commit any real attention to a paper, give it sixty seconds. Read the title, abstract, introduction (first and last paragraphs only), all section headings, and the conclusion. Glance at the figures.

After this minute, you should be able to answer three questions:
1. What problem are they solving?
2. What is their approach?
3. Does this paper matter for my work?

If the answer to question three is "no", put it down without guilt. Not every paper deserves your full attention, and learning to let go is a skill in itself.

### Pass 2: The Deep Dive

If the paper passes the skim test, block out 25–30 minutes (one Pomodoro, more on this below) and read it properly—but not linearly. Start with the methodology, then the results, then circle back to the related work. Skip the mathematical proofs on this pass unless they are central to the contribution.

The goal here is to understand the *story* of the paper. What did they do, what did they find, and why should anyone care?

Mark anything you do not understand with a question mark in the margin. Do not stop to look things up—that is a rabbit hole that will consume your session.

### Pass 3: The Critical Review

This pass is reserved for papers that are directly relevant to your research. Now you engage with the details: the proofs, the experimental setup, the assumptions. You ask adversarial questions. *Is this baseline fair? Would this generalise? What are they not telling me?*

Most papers only need Pass 1. A smaller number warrant Pass 2. Very few require Pass 3. Allocating your effort this way is not laziness—it is triage.

## Active Reading Strategies for the Distracted Mind

### The Pomodoro-Paper Hybrid

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/products/the-pomodoro-technique) — developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s — involves 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break, and it pairs beautifully with paper reading. One Pomodoro is enough for a solid Pass 2. Two Pomodoros will get you through a Pass 3 on most papers.

The key insight is that *knowing the timer is running* creates a productive urgency. You are less likely to reach for your phone when you know you only have 18 minutes left.

### Annotation as Anchor

Your pen is your best weapon against a wandering mind. When you annotate—highlight a key result, scribble a question in the margin, draw an arrow between two related ideas—you are forcing your brain to actively process the text rather than passively scan it.

I use a simple colour system: yellow for key claims, blue for things I do not understand, and red for things I disagree with. Digital or physical, it does not matter. What matters is that your hands are involved.

### The "Explain It to a Child" Test

After finishing a paper, try to summarise it in two or three sentences that a non-expert would understand. If you cannot do this, you have not understood the paper—you have only *read* it.

I sometimes do this out loud, which my flatmates find eccentric. But the act of verbalising forces a level of clarity that silent reading does not.

## Tools and Tech to Help You Focus

### Distraction Blockers

I am not above admitting that I need software to protect me from myself. Apps like Cold Turkey or the built-in Focus modes on macOS and iOS can block distracting websites and notifications during reading sessions. The small friction of having to manually disable a blocker is often enough to break the autopilot reach for Twitter.

### AI Reading Assistants: Use Them, Don't Depend on Them

I will be blunt: the volume of papers being published today is not humanly manageable. According to [arXiv's own submission statistics](https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions), monthly submissions have been consistently exceeding 20,000 since 2024 — putting the yearly total well above 240,000. No amount of Pomodoros will help you keep up with that. This is where AI tools become not just useful, but necessary.

My current favourite is [AlphaXiv](https://alphaxiv.org). It sits on top of arXiv papers and lets you ask questions about specific sections, request explanations of equations, or get a high-level summary—all grounded in the actual paper text. It is like having a knowledgeable colleague who has already read the paper and is happy to walk you through it at whatever level of detail you need. I use it heavily during Pass 1 to decide whether a paper is worth my full attention, and during Pass 2 to quickly unpack sections that would otherwise take me twenty minutes of staring at notation.

Other tools worth mentioning: Semantic Scholar's TLDR gives you one-sentence summaries that are surprisingly accurate for triage. ChatGPT and Claude can be useful for explaining concepts, but be careful—they are not grounded in the paper itself and can hallucinate details. The advantage of something like AlphaXiv is that it works *with* the paper, not from a vague memory of the training data.

That said, the warning stands: these tools are a complement to reading, not a replacement. If you only ever interact with AI-generated summaries, you will develop a shallow understanding of the literature. You will miss the nuances, the caveats, and the subtle methodological choices that separate a good researcher from someone who can recite abstracts.

The rule I follow is simple: use AI to *triage* and to *clarify*. Never use it to *replace* your own critical reading. The moment you stop forming your own opinion about a paper is the moment you stop being a researcher and start being a consumer.

### Note-Taking Systems That Actually Work

I have tried them all—Notion, Obsidian, Zotero annotations, physical notebooks, sticky notes on my monitor. The system that works is the one you actually use consistently.

That said, I have settled on a lightweight approach: for every paper I do a Pass 2 on, I write a short entry with four fields: **Problem**, **Method**, **Result**, **Relevance to my work**. It takes five minutes and saves hours when I need to revisit a paper months later.

## Building Your Reading Habit

### Starting Small: One Paper a Week

If you are not currently reading papers regularly, do not set a goal of reading one per day. You will fail by Wednesday and abandon the habit entirely. Start with one paper per week. Make it a specific slot in your calendar—I use Friday mornings—and protect that time.

Once one per week feels comfortable, scale up. But never at the expense of quality. Reading five papers badly is worse than reading one paper well.

### Creating a Reading Environment

This is underrated. If you always read papers at the same desk where you answer emails and browse Reddit, your brain will associate that space with distraction. If possible, designate a specific spot for reading—a library corner, a café, a different chair. The physical change of context signals to your brain that it is time to focus.

### Finding Your Optimal Time

Pay attention to when your focus is naturally strongest. For me, it is mid-morning, roughly 10–12. For you, it might be early morning or late evening. Schedule your reading during these windows, not in the post-lunch slump when even caffeine cannot save you.

## The Social Element

### Paper Reading Groups

One of the best things I did in my first year was join a weekly paper reading group. Knowing that you will have to discuss a paper with others is a powerful motivator to actually read it. It also exposes you to papers outside your immediate niche, which is where the most interesting ideas often come from.

If your lab does not have one, start one. It only takes three or four people and a shared calendar invite.

### Academic Twitter (X) and Threads

For all its flaws, academic social media is genuinely useful for paper discovery. Following researchers in your field and engaging with their threads can surface papers you would never have found through keyword searches alone.

The trick is to use it as a *discovery tool*, not a reading tool. When you find an interesting paper through a thread, save it to your reading list and close the app. Do not try to understand a paper through someone else's tweet thread.

### Turning Passive Reading into Active Discussion

After you read a paper, talk about it. With your supervisor, your labmates, your reading group, or even in a short post on social media. The act of articulating your thoughts to another person is the most effective form of retention there is.

Every paper I have truly internalised is one I have discussed with someone else. Every paper I have forgotten is one I read in isolation and never mentioned again.

## When to Skim, When to Deep Dive

Not all papers are created equal, and your time is finite. Here is a rough heuristic I use:

- **Skim only (Pass 1):** Papers from adjacent fields, survey papers where you only need the taxonomy, papers cited by a paper you are actually reading.
- **Read properly (Pass 2):** Papers in your direct area, papers your supervisor recommended, papers you intend to cite.
- **Full critical read (Pass 3):** Papers you are building directly on top of, papers you plan to compare against, papers that introduce a method you want to reproduce.

Being honest about which category a paper falls into saves an enormous amount of time and guilt.

## Conclusion: Reclaiming Your Focus

The TikTok era has not made us stupid. It has made us distracted. And distraction is a problem with solutions—imperfect, effortful solutions, but solutions nonetheless.

You do not need to read every paper from cover to cover. You do not need to understand every equation on the first pass. You do not need to feel guilty about your attention span. What you need is a system: a way to triage, a way to focus, and a way to retain.

Start with one paper this week. Give it sixty seconds. If it earns your attention, give it twenty-five minutes more. And if it truly matters, give it everything you have.

Your attention is your most valuable resource as a researcher. Spend it wisely.
