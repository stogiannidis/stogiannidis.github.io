> When your attention span is shorter than a TikTok video, how do you get through a 30-page paper?

## The Problem

I study AI for a living and I still catch myself reaching for my phone mid-paragraph. If you have ever re-read the same sentence four times because your brain drifted off, you are not alone.

A [2019 Nature Communications study](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09311-w) found that our collective attention span is getting shorter. On Twitter, hashtags stayed in the top 50 for 17.5 hours in 2013 but only 11.9 hours by 2016. The same pattern showed up in books, movies, and search trends. We are built for 15-second clips now, but papers are still long and dense.

The fix, of course, is to read more papers. But how do you do that when your brain is screaming for a dopamine hit every five minutes?

## Why "Just Read It" Does Not Work

When I was an undergrad, the advice was always: "Just read the papers." It was like telling someone to "just run a marathon" without training. It assumes you have the time and focus to do it, which is not true for most of us. Each one of us 
is dealing with a constant barrage of notifications, emails, and the siren call of social media. Expecting to read papers in that environment is unrealistic. Furthermore, what happend if you start readining the paper and you realise in the middle that it is not relevant to your work? Do you finish it anyway? Do you skim the rest? Do you just give up and move on? The "just read it" advice does not give you any tools to make those decisions.

This is why the "Three-Pass Method" is so useful.
## The Three-Pass Method

This method is quite old, S. Keshav ["How to Read a Paper"](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf) (ACM SIGCOMM, 2007). Here is a brief summary of how it works–even thought I'd recommend reading the original paper for more details.

### Pass 1: 60-Second Skim

Give every paper just one minute first. Read the title, abstract, first and last paragraphs of the intro, section headings, and conclusion. Look at the figures.

After that you should know:
1. What problem are they solving?
2. What is their approach?
3. Does this matter for my work?

If the answer to #3 is no, move on. Most papers stop here and that is fine.

### Pass 2: The Real Read

Set a 25-minute timer and read the paper properly — but not front to back. Start with the method, then results, then related work. Skip proofs unless they are the main point.

The goal is to get the *story*: what they did, what they found, and why it matters. Mark anything confusing with a "?" in the margin. Do not stop to Google things — that is a rabbit hole.

### Pass 3: The Deep Read

Only for papers directly related to your research. Now you go through the proofs, the experiment details, the assumptions. You ask tough questions: *Is this baseline fair? Would this work in practice? What are they leaving out?*

Most papers need only Pass 1. Some need Pass 2. Very few need Pass 3. This is not being lazy — it is being smart with your time.

## Staying Focused

Now, I'm not here to write yet another article about the "Three-Pass Method." You can find that everywhere. Instead, I want to talk about how do you *adapt* it in the age of TikTok. The following advices are based on my own experience and might not work for everyone, but they are worth trying.

### Use a Timer


## Tools

### Block Distractions

Apps like Cold Turkey or the built-in Focus modes on macOS/iOS can block distracting sites during reading time. Just the small effort of having to turn off the blocker is often enough to stop you from opening Twitter on autopilot.

### AI Assistants

Let's be real: there are too many papers to keep up with. [arXiv gets over 20,000 submissions a month](https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions) now. You need help filtering.

My go-to is [AlphaXiv](https://alphaxiv.org). It works directly on arXiv papers — you can ask it about specific sections, get explanations of equations, or get a quick summary. Unlike ChatGPT or Claude, it is grounded in the actual paper text so it does not make things up. I use it during Pass 1 to decide if a paper is worth reading, and during Pass 2 to quickly understand tricky parts.

Semantic Scholar's TLDR is also good for one-line summaries when triaging.

But here is the thing: **AI is for filtering and clarifying, not for replacing your reading.** If you only read AI summaries you will have a shallow understanding of your field. You will miss the details that actually matter. Use AI to decide *what* to read, then read it yourself.

### Notes

I have tried every note-taking app out there. The best system is whatever you will actually use. Mine is simple: for every paper I do a Pass 2 on, I write down four things — **Problem**, **Method**, **Result**, **Relevance to my work**. Takes five minutes, saves hours later.

## Building the Habit

**Start with one paper a week.** Do not aim for one a day — you will burn out by Wednesday. Pick a fixed time (I use Friday mornings) and protect it. Scale up only when it feels easy.

**Change your environment.** If you read papers at the same desk where you check email and browse Reddit, your brain will associate that spot with distractions. Try a library, a cafe, or just a different chair.

**Find your best hours.** I focus best from 10 to 12. You might be different. Read during your peak focus time, not after lunch when you are half asleep.

## Make It Social

**Join a reading group.** Knowing you have to discuss a paper with others is the best motivation to actually read it. If your lab does not have one, start one — three or four people and a calendar invite is all you need.

**Use academic social media for discovery.** Twitter/X and Threads are great for finding papers you would not have found otherwise. But use them to *find* papers, not to *read* them. Save it to your list and close the app.

**Talk about what you read.** With your supervisor, labmates, or reading group. Every paper I actually remember is one I discussed with someone. Every paper I forgot is one I read alone and never mentioned again.

## Quick Reference: What Gets Which Pass

- **Pass 1 only:** Papers from nearby fields, surveys you need for one section, papers cited by something you are reading.
- **Pass 2:** Papers in your area, papers your supervisor suggested, papers you will cite.
- **Pass 3:** Papers you are building on, papers you are comparing against, methods you want to reproduce.

## Wrap Up

The TikTok era has not made us dumb. It has made us distracted. That is fixable.

You do not need to read every paper cover to cover. You do not need to get every equation on the first try. You just need a system: a way to filter, a way to focus, and a way to remember.

Start with one paper this week. Give it sixty seconds. If it is worth it, give it twenty-five minutes more.
