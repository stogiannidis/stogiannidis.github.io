## About Me

I am completing my M.Sc in Computer Science at Athens University of Economics and
Business under the supervision of [Prof. Ion Androutsopoulos](https://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/) and and at the time being, I am a Machine Learning Research Engineer at
[helvia.ai](https://helvia.ai/), specializing in NLP and Large Language Models. I am also an active member of the <a href="http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/" target="_blank"> Natural Language Processing Group </a>
at AUEB were we conduct research on NLP and Machine Learning.
