## About Me

I am completing my M.Sc in Computer Science at Athens University of Economics and
Business under the supervision of [Prof. Ion Androutsopoulos](https://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/) and at the time being, I am a Machine Learning Research Engineer at [helvia.ai](https://helvia.ai/), specializing in NLP and Large Language Models. I am also an active member of the <a href="http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/" target="_blank"> Natural Language Processing Group </a> at AUEB where we conduct research on NLP and Machine Learning.

Feel free to contact me via the provided email. Time where I am is currently: <span id="time"></span>
## Research Interests


- **Natural Language Processing:** Cost-efficient usage and optimization of LLMs, open-book generative QA, text summarization.
- **Machine Learning:** Active learning, knowledge distillation, adversarial learning.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Decision-making in complex systems, improved NLG, wireless network routing optimization, vehicular networks and self-driving cars.

## News
